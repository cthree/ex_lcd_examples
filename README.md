# ExLCD Examples

This repository contains example applications designed to demonstrate how to use the [ExLCD](https://github.com/cthree/ex_lcd) package and API in your projects. These are all based on [Nerves](http://nerves-project.org) on a variety of SBC platforms I have available.

Please see the README file within each example application for details on how to build it, hookup the display and upload it to your device for demo or testing.
